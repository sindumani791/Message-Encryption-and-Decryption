What is Cryptography
The word cryptography comes from the Greek words kryptos, which means "hidden", and graphein, which means "to write".
Cryptography isÂ the practice of developing and using coded algorithms to protect and obscure transmitted information so that it may only be read by those with the permission and ability to decrypt it.
It involves the use of algorithms and keys to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
Cryptography is essential in various applications , including secure communications , data protection , and authentication processes in digital systems.
Terminologies:
Plain Text : Plain text is a original message, readable data or information that is input into a cryptographic algorithm before it is transformed into an unreadable format.
Cipher Text : Cipher text is a coded message or information which is transformed into unreadable format and it is output of the cryptography algorithm.
Key : A key is a string or piece of information used in conjunction with an algorithm to perform encryption and decryption. 
Encryption : Encryption is the process by which a readable message(plain text) is converted to an unreadable form(cipher text).
Decryption : Decryption is the process of converting an encrypted message(cipher text) back to its  readable format(plain text).
Cryptography : Study of encryption principles or methods for encryption.
Crypto Analysis : Study of principles or methods for decrypt the cipher text without knowing the key.
Algorithm Used:
Symmetric encryption is a method of encryption that uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt data. It's also known as symmetric key cryptography or secret-key encryption.
How it works
The sender and receiver must both have the same key, which can be a password or a randomly generated string of letters or numbers. The sender encrypts the data with the key, and the receiver decrypts it with the same key. 
Advantages
Symmetric encryption is simple and efficient, and is often used for high-volume data processing. 
Disadvantages
Symmetric encryption has some security challenges because the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. For example, the key must be kept private, and there are security issues with exchanging the key between the sender and receiver. 
Common algorithms
Two common symmetric encryption algorithms are DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). 
Use cases
Symmetric encryption is used to verify website server authenticity, exchange encryption keys, and generate sessions. It's also used in banking for encryption. 
Combining with asymmetric encryption
Symmetric encryption is often combined with asymmetric encryption, which uses different keys for encryption and decryption
